# L0
## Syntax
### Address
Point to a location in memory and assign it an identifier.
### Allocate
Allocate a specified amount of memory.
### Branch
Create a conditional. Specify the operator, then the terms on the left and right to perform the operation on. If true, navigate to consequent. If not, navigate to otherwise.
### Call
Retrieve a value and assign it to one or more identifiers.
### Copy
Take a source identifier and copy its value to a destination identifier.
### Halt
Return from a function.
### Identifier
Data type that gives names to variables and functions. Acts as an input to most functions.
### Immediate
Simplest data type, consisting solely of integers.
### Load
Pull data from allocated memory.
### Primitive
Perform simple math (add, subtract, multiply) with the syntax [operand] [operator1] [operator2].
### Statement
A sequence of functions or operations that can be passed to other functions or operations.
### Store
Push information into a specified allocated location of memory.

## Differences from L1
Identifiers are no longer applied to values, and instead the memory address is bound to an identifier. Call can be used to put data in these memory addresses.
